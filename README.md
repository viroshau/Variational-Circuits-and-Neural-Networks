# Variational Circuits and Neural Networks
 Files for my master thesis on the use of machine learning in variational quantum circuits

The following video illustrates the ESCAPE procedure using $g(t) = t/T$ at step 4 of the procedure. As the video illustrates, the procedure actively alters the QAOA landscape in a way to escape the initially found local minima. The initial frame is in the completely altered landcape, and the landscape at various $t$ are animated.
